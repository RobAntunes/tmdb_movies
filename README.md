# tmdb_movies

A small demo movie app using the TMDB API.

## Instructions
* Clone this repository
* Install dependencies (npm i)
* launch start script (npm run start)

## Quick Notes

### Tech 
- React, bootstrapped using Create-React-App.
- SASS, used as a simple way to scope css locally.
- TypeScript

### TODO:
Perfect is the enemy of done as they say.
Given a bit of extra time I would:
* Fix layout, responsiveness and alignment issues.
* Implement search by title
* Implement an abstraction for filter and sort pipeline (not quite sure on best approach).
* Move global state init into HOC (?)
